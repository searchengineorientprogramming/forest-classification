# Machine learning model and geometric phase calculation - code package
The repository includes code to do the FFT and machine learning to train model, test and inspection, the geometric phase calculation code.

To run code, create a virtual environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`, then activate the environment `seismic-ml`.

- `Raw_ML` - Includes raw signal FFT data and machine learning code and results.
- `CC_ML` - Includes CC signal FFT data, machine learning code and results and geometric phase change calculation code.
